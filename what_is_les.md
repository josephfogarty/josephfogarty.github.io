# What is LES?

## Turbulence in the Environment

Most geophysical flows are turbulent, meaning that

##

A large-eddy simulation is a numerical model that aims to simulate the flow of a turbulent fluid at a reduced computational cost than directly solving the Navier-Stokes equations of motion.




For example, the continuity equation would look like:

\[\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}
    = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
    + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 0.\]

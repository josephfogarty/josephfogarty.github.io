title: What is LES?
excerpt: "The importance of large-eddy simulations"
---

Short answer: A large-eddy simulation (LES) is a turbulence-resolving computational and numerical method that models flow by solving filtered equations of motion.

Long answer: Most geophysical flows are turbulent. That is, rivers, atmospheric flows, ocean currents etc., all have high _Reynolds numbers_, defined as

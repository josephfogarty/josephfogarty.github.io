### Large-Eddy Simulations of the Arctic ABL

Large-eddy simulations are the numerical model of choice for my research, as they allow turbulence to be resolved in high-reynolds number flows (such as the atmospheric boundary layer). Conducting simulations over a sea ice surface (specifying bottom boundary conditions based on whether a node is classified as "ice" or "water") allows one to study high-resolution fluid flows and statistics of an otherwise remote region of the globe. The start of this research is now published in _Boundary-Layer Meteorology_ [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-023-00825-x)!

See [What is LES?](what_is_les.md) for more information on what LES is, and why it is used in my research.

### Surface Heterogeneity Quantification

Many techniques are used to quantify the heterogeneity of a surface. Quantifying a surface is useful in coarse geophysical models that cannot resolve heterogeneity less than the grid cell. Techniques currently being investigated here include second-order statistics (such as variograms) of surface maps of temperature and roughness, and probability density functions (PDFs) of length scales of ice and water. A preprint of this work is currently being reviewed at _Cryosphere_, and we will post updates when it is under discussion at EGU!

### Sea Ice Surface Energy Balance (IceSUBS)

One of the first projects I worked on in graduate school, IceSUBS (Ice SUrface energy Balance) is a vertical one-dimensional model that solves the heat equation in a block of sea ice, while simultaneously solving the surface energy balance (SEB) of said sea ice. This model includes test parameterizations for processes such as bulk air temperature, net radiation, sensible and latent heat, and ground conduction. More information coming soon!

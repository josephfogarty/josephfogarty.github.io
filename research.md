### Sea Ice Surface Energy Balance (IceSUBS)

IceSUBS (Ice SUrface energy Balance) is a vertical one-dimensional model that solves the heat equation in a block of sea ice, while simultaneously solving the surface energy balance (SEB) of said sea ice. This model includes test parameterizations for processes such as bulk air temperature, net radiation, sensible and latent heat, and ground conduction. More information coming soon!

### Large-Eddy Simulations of the Arctic ABL

More coming soon! See [What is LES?](what_is_les.md) for more information on what LES is.

### Surface Heterogeneity Quantification

Many techniques are used to quantify the heterogeneity of a surface. Quantifying a surface is useful in coarse geophysical models that cannot resolve heterogeneity less than the grid cell. Techniques currently being investigated here include second-order statistics (such as variograms) and probability density functions (PDF). More coming soon!

### Large-Eddy Simulations of the Arctic ABL

Large-eddy simulations* are the numerical model of choice for my research, as they allow turbulence to be resolved in high-reynolds number flows (such as the atmospheric boundary layer). Conducting simulations over a sea ice surface (specifying bottom boundary conditions based on whether a node is classified as "ice" or "water") allows one to study high-resolution fluid flows and statistics of an otherwise remote region of the globe. The first part of this research, analyzing [how alternating ice and water patches affect the the Arctic Boundary Layer](docs/papers/s10546-023-00825-x.pdf){:target="_blank"}, is now published in *Boundary-Layer Meteorology*. A second manuscript is currently under preparation.

*See [What is LES?](what_is_les.md) for more information on what LES is, and why it is used in my research.

### Surface Heterogeneity Quantification

Many techniques are used to quantify the heterogeneity of a surface. Quantifying a surface is useful in coarse geophysical models that cannot resolve heterogeneity less than the grid cell. Techniques investigated in the past here include second-order statistics (such as variograms) of surface maps of temperature and roughness, and probability density functions (PDFs) of length scales of ice and water. Our work bridges the lattice-data quantification metrics, used in landscape ecology, for analyzing sea ice surfaces. A [preprint of this work](docs/papers/egusphere-2024-532.pdf){:target="_blank"} is currently under discussion at EGUsphere.

### Sea Ice Surface Energy Balance (IceSUBS)

One of the first projects I worked on in graduate school, IceSUBS (Ice SUrface energy Balance) is a vertical one-dimensional model that solves the heat equation in a block of sea ice, while simultaneously solving the surface energy balance (SEB) of said sea ice. This model includes test parameterizations for processes such as bulk air temperature, net radiation, sensible and latent heat, and ground conduction. More information coming soon!

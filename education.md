### Undergraduate Work

As mentioned on the front page, my undergraduate degree was earned in the [Department of Meteorology](https://meteorology.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Rutgers University in May 2018. Along with the Meteorology major, I also earned two minors in [Environmental Sciences](http://envsci.rutgers.edu/academics/envsci/minor_in_envsci.html){:target="_blank"} and [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/minors){:target="_blank"}.

During my senior year, I completed a George H. Cook Honors project titled, ['Drizzle Evaporation in the Stratocumulus-Topped Boundary Layer and its Relationship with Sub-Cloud Turbulence.'](docs/JJF_undergrad_GHC.pdf){:target="_blank"} This project was an analysis conducted in the realm of my favorite discipline of meteorology, the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).

### Graduate Work

The undergraduate combination of the meteorology, mathematics and environmental science led to my current work at Princeton Unversity as part of the [Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM)](http://efm.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} research group, under the advisement of Professor Elie Bou-Zeid in the department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)](https://cee.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My overall research combines numerical and observational methods to understand how the constantly-changing Arctic sea ice surface is affected by the ABL, and what feedbacks exist between the Arctic ABL, sea ice, and the ocean. As of May 2020, I have passed my general exam and am now doing research as a Ph.D. candidate. See more details of my work in the [Research](research.md) and [What is LES?](what_is_les.md) tabs.

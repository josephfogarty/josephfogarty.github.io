### Undergraduate Work

As mentioned on the front page, my undergraduate degree was earned in the [Department of Meteorology](https://meteorology.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University in May 2018. Along with the Meteorology major, I also earned two minors in [Environmental Sciences](http://envsci.rutgers.edu/academics/envsci/minor_in_envsci.html) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/minors).

During my senior year, I completed a George H. Cook Honors project titled, 'Drizzle Evaporation in the Stratocumulus-Topped Boundary Layer and its Relationship with Sub-Cloud Turbulence.' This project was an analysis conducted in the realm of my favorite part of meteorology, the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).



### Graduate Work

The combination of the meteorology major with both the mathematics and environmental science minor led to my current work in Princeton University's CEE department under the advisement of Professor Elie Bou-Zeid. Combining numerical and observational methods, my overall aim is to understand how the constantly-changing Arctic sea ice surface is affected by the ABL, and vice versa.

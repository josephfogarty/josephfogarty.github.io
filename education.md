### Undergraduate Work

As mentioned on the front page, my undergraduate degree was earned in the [Department of Meteorology](https://meteorology.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University in May 2018. Along with the Meteorology major, I also earned two minors in [Environmental Sciences](http://envsci.rutgers.edu/academics/envsci/minor_in_envsci.html) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/minors).

During my senior year, I completed a George H. Cook Honors project titled, 'Drizzle Evaporation in the Stratocumulus-Topped Boundary Layer and its Relationship with Sub-Cloud Turbulence.' This project was an analysis conducted in the realm of my favorite part of meteorology, the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).

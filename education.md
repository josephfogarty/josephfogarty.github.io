### Undergraduate Work

As mentioned on the front page, my undergraduate degree was earned in the [Department of Meteorology](https://meteorology.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Rutgers University in May 2018. Along with the Meteorology major, I also earned two minors in [Environmental Sciences](http://envsci.rutgers.edu/academics/envsci/minor_in_envsci.html){:target="_blank"} and [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/minors){:target="_blank"}.

During my senior year, I completed a George H. Cook Honors project titled, ['Drizzle Evaporation in the Stratocumulus-Topped Boundary Layer and its Relationship with Sub-Cloud Turbulence.'](docs/JJF_undergrad_GHC.pdf){:target="_blank"} This project was an analysis conducted in the realm of my favorite discipline of meteorology, the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).

### Graduate Work

The undergraduate combination of the meteorology, mathematics and environmental science led to my current work as part of the [Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM)](http://efm.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} research group, under the advisement or Professor Elie Bou-Zeid in the department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)](https://cee.princeton.edu/). My overall research combines numerical and observational methods to understand how the constantly-changing Arctic sea ice surface is affected by the ABL, and what feedbacks exist between the Arctic ABL, sea ice, and the ocean. See more in the 'Research' and 'What is LES?'' tab.

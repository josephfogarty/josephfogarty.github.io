Welcome to my website! My name is Joseph Fogarty, a graduate student who recently defended my Ph.D. this past May.  Please feel free to explore this website for an overview of current research activities, projects, and anything else I may be working on.

See my recently published paper in The Cryosphere, ["How Many Parameters are Needed to Represent Polar Sea Ice Surface Patterns and Heterogeneity?"](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/18/4335/2024/tc-18-4335-2024.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Also, see our [recent preprint](https://essopenarchive.org/users/811250/articles/1212725-numerical-simulations-of-satellite-sensed-surface-maps-in-the-marginal-ice-zone), currently under review at the AGU Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.

## About Me

A little more about me: I am currently a Water Resource Engineer at the [Delaware River Basin Commission](https://www.nj.gov/drbc/), conducting and analyzing hydrodynamic and water quality simulations of the Delaware River. I defended my Ph.D. candidacy at Princeton University in the [Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM)](http://efm.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} research group, in the department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)](https://cee.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. During my undergraduate studies in [Meteorology](https://meteorology.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Rutgers University, I realized my interests are less aligned with traditional operational forecasting, and more so with understanding the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere, the larger implications within the geosciences and environmental sciences, and the computational and mathematical tools required to study such phenomena.

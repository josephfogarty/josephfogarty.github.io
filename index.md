Welcome to my website! My name is Joseph Fogarty, a graduate student currently enrolled at Princeton University. Please feel free to explore this website for an overview of current research activities, projects, and anything else I may be working on.

See my recent paper on [how alternating ice and water patches affect the the Arctic Boundary Layer](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-023-00825-x), published in *Boundary-Layer Meteorology*.

## About Me

A little more about me: I am a fifth-year graduate student at Princeton University in the [Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM)](http://efm.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} research group, in the department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)](https://cee.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. During my undergraduate studies in [Meteorology](https://meteorology.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Rutgers University, I realized my interests are less aligned with traditional operational forecasting, and more so with understanding the fluid dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), and the larger implications of the ABL on anthropogenic climate change. Numerical, observational, and theoretical techniques are used to understand not only the ABL, but the importance of surface-atmosphere interactions. Currently, I am using large-eddy simulations (LES) to simulate and understand the Arctic ABL over changing sea ice states.

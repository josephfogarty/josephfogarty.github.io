# Welcome!

Welcome to my website! My name  is Joseph Fogarty, a graduate student currently enrolled at Princeton University. Please feel free to explore this website for an overview of current research activities, projects, and anything else I may be working on.

## About Me

A little about me: I am a third-year graduate student at Princeton University in the [Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM)](http://efm.princeton.edu/) research group, in the department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)](https://cee.princeton.edu/). Although I obtained my undergraduate degree in [Meteorology](https://meteorology.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University, my interests are less aligned with traditional operational forecasting, and more with the fluid dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). My research applies fluid mechanics to the intersection of humans and the environment; more specifically the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Currently, I am using large-eddy simulations (LES) to simulate and understand the ABL over changing sea ice states.

Welcome to my website! My name is Joseph Fogarty, a graduate student currently enrolled at Princeton University. Please feel free to explore this website for an overview of current research activities, projects, and anything else I may be working on.

See my recent preprint under discussion at EGUsphere, ["How Many Parameters are Needed to Represent Polar Sea Ice Surface Patterns and Heterogeneity?"](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-532).

## About Me

A little more about me: I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University in the [Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM)](http://efm.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"} research group, in the department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)](https://cee.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. During my undergraduate studies in [Meteorology](https://meteorology.rutgers.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Rutgers University, I realized my interests are less aligned with traditional operational forecasting, and more so with understanding the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere, the larger implications within the geosciences and environmental sciences, and the computational and mathematical tools required to study such phenomena.

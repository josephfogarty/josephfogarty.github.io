### Relating The Reynolds Number to the Strouhal Number

#### Background

Fluid mechanics is overflowing with dimensionless numbers, and one of the most important numbers (if not _the_ most important number) is Reynolds number is one of the most important numbers  in fluid mechanics. It is defined as $$Re=UL/\nu$$, and describes the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.

But we cannot neglect other dimensionaless numbers. One of the lesser known numbers, the Strouhal number

Human societies attempt to alter environment cycles to improve both ecosystem productivity and quality. Many complexities involved in Coupled Human And Natural Systems (CHANS), and this project was just one exploration into a mathematical model proposed in [Poporato et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017289){:target="_blank"}.

This model is a two-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Dynamical systems are an excellent tools that can provide insight on the interactions between two quantities, and the feedbacks that occur between them. What I did for this project was offers an exploration into this pre-proposed mathematical models, and expand on the work to understand how different parameters relate to one another.

The model in the paper is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

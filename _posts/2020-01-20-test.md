### Applying Dynamical Analysis to Human-Environment Interactions

Human societies attempt to alter environment cycles to improve both ecosystem productivity and quality. Many complexities are involved in Coupled Human And Natural Systems (CHANS), and this final project for CEE588: Ecohydrology was a simple exploration into a mathematical model proposed in [Poporato et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017289){:target="_blank"}.

The model proposed is a nonlinear system of two ordinary differential equations. This type of system lends itself well to dynamical analysis, which is an excellent tools that provides insight on the interactions and feedbacks between two variables and their parameters. This small project offers an exploration into this pre-proposed mathematical models.

### Model and Analysis

The model in the paper is given by the two nonlinear ODEs:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{d}q}{\text{d}t} &= \eta_0 + k_{nat}q(A-A_{ag}) - k_{ag}A_{ag}-c\bigg(\frac{q}{q_0}\bigg)^{\alpha} \\
\frac{\text{d}A_{ag}}{\text{d}t} &= (k_h q A_{ag} + A_0)\bigg(1-\frac{A_{ag}}{A}\bigg)
\end{align*}
$$

where $$q$$ and $$A_{ag}$$ are the two main variables in this system, representing ecosystem quality and agricultural land area, respectfully. All other variables are constants that can be changed depending on the ecosystem. $$q_0$$ is some reference ecosystem quality, $$A$$ is the total land area, which is the sum of $$A_{ag}$$ and $$A_{nat}$$, the natural land area. $$A_0$$ is the rate of external market influence and $$\eta_0$$ are external inputs from surroundings. Finally, there are control parameters that also differ based on the ecosystem and how much human influence there is. $$k_{nat}$$ is a conversion from quality to ecosystem services, $$k_{ag}$$ is the degradation rate from nearby agricultural practices, and $$k_h$$ is the development rate of agricultural land in response to production. Lastly, two other parameters are defined, $$c$$ is the rate of turnover and $$\alpha$$ is some equilibrium control value. Quite a mouthful to define all parameters of this system, but it shows how important many different human-environment processes are to the well-being of an ecosystem.

An analytical solution to this system is highly improbable due to the nonlinear nature of the system. Therefore we hope to approximate the phase portrait near a fixed point $$(x^{*},y^{*})$$. Figure 3 in [Poporato et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017289){:target="\_blank"} has already identified a fixed stable point at $$(q,A_{ag})=(0,0.5)$$. Thus to linearize the system, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix at this fixed point, resulting in

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{nat}\bigg(A-\frac{1}{2}\bigg) & -k_{ag} \\
k_h\frac{2A-1}{4A} & -\frac{A_0}{A}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To determine how this system behaves around this fixed point, we want to analyze the eigenvalues. We are interested in complex eigenvalues, because the system is classified as stable and behaves as a spiral/center. The eigenvalues are complex in this linearized system when the discriminant $$\tau^2 - 4\Delta<0$$ (where $$\tau$$ is the trace and $$\Delta$$ is the determinant). Solving for this case, we find that the criteria for a stable linearized system is

$$
\begin{equation}
k_h > \frac{1}{k_{ag}}\bigg[
\frac{A_0^2}{A(2A-1)}-3A_0 k_{nat}+\frac{A(2A-1)}{4}k_{nat}^2
\bigg]\,.
\end{equation}
$$

We will call the RHS of the above equation $$K(A_0,k_ag,k_{nat})$$. What's left to do here is an analysis. There are many ways to go about analyzing this equation - what I've decided to do is see how the math relates to the definitions of the variables.

Recall that a stable/spiral solution to this system corresponds to some equilibrium cycle. An unstable solution corresponds to the breaking of this cycle, for example mass degradation. So, assuming a fixed total land area $$A$$, how does varying the parameters $$A_0$$, $$k_{nat}$$, and $$k_{ag}$$ control this systems ability to behave as said limit cycle that oscillates between production and degradation? And does it make sense physically?

In the above figure, the three parameters $$A_0$$, $$k_{nat}$$, and $$k_{ag}$$ are varied separately, and the relation $$k_h = K(A_0,k_ag,k_{nat})$$ is plotted. Above this line, the discriminant is negative, the eigenvalues are complex, and the system exhibits a stable/spiral solution. In the first plot, if $$A_0$$ increases, then the threshold for $$k_h>K(A_0,k_ag,k_{nat})$$ increases. Physically, this means that an increase in external markets that drive land cultivation must be matched by the rate at which agricultural land is developed. For the center plot, using the same reasoning, we conclude that as we acquire more services from an ecosystem, then the rate at which agricultural land is developed must also increase. Finally, for the third plot, it is clear that as the degradation rate of a system increase (due to increased nearby agricultural practices), then the rate at which agricultural land is developed decreases.

The above statements may seem obvious, but the analysis here showed that using a mathematical model allows us to come to these conclusions. There are many different ways one can analyze the system of equations that I started with, but this is the route that I took. I hope you enjoyed this little foray into some mathematical modeling and dynamical analysis that I don't get to experience often in my work.

### The Wallis Product

#### Background

While browsing YouTube, I happen to come across something called the [Wallis Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product){:target="\_blank"}. No, it is not named after the [CEO of Dunder Mifflin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a0/David_Wallace_%28The_Office%29.jpg), but rather the English mathematician John Wallis. Essentially, it is an infinite product that converges to $$\pi/2$$, defined as

$$
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\pi}{2} &= \prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{4n^2}{4n^2-1}
    = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{2n}{2n-1}\cdot\frac{2n}{2n+1}\bigg) \\
    &= \bigg(\frac{2}{1}\cdot\frac{2}{3}\bigg)\cdot
    \bigg(\frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{4}{5}\bigg)\cdot
    \bigg(\frac{6}{5}\cdot\frac{6}{7}\bigg)\cdot
    \cdots
\end{align*}
$$

By no means do I intend to prove this here (there are plenty of proofs all around the internet), but I thought it would be fun to visualize this series using Python.  

#### Analysis

What I thought would be a quick one-and-done visualization, actually led to something (slightly) more interesting. I first went about this by pre-populating two lists, one would be the numerator sequence $$u_n=2,2,4,4,\cdots$$ and one would be the denominator sequence $$d_n=1,2,2,5,\cdots$$. For some reason, I then had the bright idea to first calculate the entire numerator product, then the entire denominator product, and then divide those two gargantuan numbers. When plotting the sequence, I unsurprisingly ended up with the following:

There is some convergence at the beginning, but after about $$n=12$$ there is no more convergence to $$\pi/2$$, and then around $$n=$$ in fact it seems like it goes to zero. But really, the floating-point arithmetic utilized by Python started bugging out. Around $$n=12$$, the numerator is equal to

$$2\cdot 2\cdot 4\cdot 4\cdot 6\cdot 6\cdot 8\cdot 8\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 12\cdot 12\cdot = 2,123,366,400$$

which is also about 1% of Jeff Bezos' net worth in US dollars. Note that in this method, I iterate through each individual fraction, starting with $$n_1=u_1/d_1=2/1$$, then $$n_2=u_2/d_2=2/3$$, and so forth. So, it was clear to see why my code was bugging out - as these numbers got [factorially larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial), the computer could not process them.

I decided to regroup and calculate this product using two other methods. For the second method, I made the simple fix of swapping the order of operations: instead of numerator product divided by denominator product, I took the product of each individual fraction one at a time. For the third method, I simply used the formula above instead of using the pre-populated lists in my code. I thought they would be the same, but apparently, they are different:

This difference is due to the fact that when I use my pre-populated list (Method 2), the iteration is through each individual fraction, giving it that oscillating converging behavior. When using the formula (Method 3), the product still converged to $$pi/2$$, but there was no oscillating behavior, because these terms are essentially the terms in Method 2, just multiplied in pairs. In other words, the products of Method 2 was $$u_1/d_1$$, $$u_2/d_2$$, $$u_3/d_3$$, etc., while the products of Method 3 was $$u_1u_2/d_1d_2$$, $$u_3u_4/d_3d_4$$, and so forth.

So, there's really not much else I did here, but it was interesting to me and I figured I'd share what I did. The python code I used can be downloaded [here](/docs/wallis_product.py){:target="\_blank"}, for those interested.
